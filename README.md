# Opera House DB

This is a **__very basic__** databsae I deisgned and implemented for my databases university project.
I am fully aware that there are plenty of things I could've done differently however I can say that
the addition of more features required more time than I had and were better suited for a different 
kind of database project.

I am open to suggestions and to participate in real life projects in order to sharpen the skills
gained during the uni course.
