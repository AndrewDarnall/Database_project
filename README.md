# Opera House DB

This is a **__very basic__** databsae I deisgned and implemented for my databases university project.
I am fully aware that there are plenty of things I could've done differently however I can say that
the addition of more features required more time than I had and were better suited for a different 
kind of database project.

I am open to suggestions and to participate in real life projects in order to sharpen the skills
gained during the uni course.

Some of the mentioned skills are:

- SQL3
- PL/SQL
- ER diagrams & conceptual design
- Logical Design
- Rleational, NoSQL, Semantic and XML databases
- Normalization, i.e. BCNF, 3NF

###Used technologies:

- MySQL
- DB2
- Oracle DB
- Microsoft SQL Server
- XAMPP
- PhpMyAdmin
- MySQL workbench
- C/C++, Java, Python and Php connector libraries
